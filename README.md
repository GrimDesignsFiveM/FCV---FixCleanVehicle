# FCV---FixCleanVehicle

This was requested, so here it is! I created this fairly quickly (~5-10 minutes) and I’m pretty new to this so please critique if possible! I also didn’t comment anything because, as I said, I made it quickly. Have fun! :slight_smile:

Installation
Install it as any normal script.

Config
Open server.lua
Don’t touch the code. Look at the Config.

everyoneAllowed - It is False at default.

True - Everyone is allowed to use the command, you do not need to add anyone to the allowed table
False - You need to add people to the allowed table to give them permission to use the table
allowed - Enter your steam IDs and IPs. DO NOT forget the commas and do not add a comma at the end.

Usage
Get in a vehicle and type “/fix” to fix it or type “/clean” to clean it in chat.
